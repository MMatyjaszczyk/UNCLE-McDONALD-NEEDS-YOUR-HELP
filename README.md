# UNCLE McDONALD NEEDS YOUR HELP
For Motorola:>

## Why I code?

Because it's fun. Lately I mainly do LeetCode, sometimes Project Euler. Big projects are fun too.
When you have some problem, and you look into solutions, and this spark of some better idea comes to your mind. This is so exciting:>
Whene it comes to proffesion, I want to get into IT because, first of all, money, but also I want to see a full potential of what people can do with just some electric boxes and keyboards. I think Motorola is pretty cool, so I wanted to give it a try:>
So, to sum up, I code because it's fun.
